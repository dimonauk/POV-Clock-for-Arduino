# POV-Clock-for-Arduino
A Persistence of Vision clock for the Arduino platform

This is a simple clock based on the Arduino Uno. The circuit has been
breadboarded and tested with the software. Note that the clock does
not use a real-time clock (RTC) module or sub-circuit, so the long-term
accuracy of the clock is not necessarily optimum. Nonetheless, this
circuit and software are a good introduction to the concept of using
persistence of vision displays. The user is encouraged to modify the 
"font" to generate custom stylized characters.
